# Ruby Comparison Operators
=begin
    == Equal Operator
    != Not Equal
    > Greater than
    < Less than
    >= Greater or equal
    <= Less than or equal
    <=> Combined comparison Operator.return 0 if first operand equal second,
    1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second
    === test equality e.g. (1...10) === 5 returns true
    .eql? true if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equla values
    equal? true if the receiver and argument have the same object id.
